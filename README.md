# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using Random Forest
This project aims to predict Alzheimer's disease in patients using a machine learning approach. A Random Forest Classifier is trained on structured health data and evaluated using standard classification metrics and cross-validation techniques.

# Dataset
The dataset used is stored in a CSV file:

alzheimers_disease_data.csv

It contains anonymized patient information along with a Diagnosis column indicating the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease.

# Features
Cleans and preprocesses patient data

Handles missing values using column-wise median

Trains a Random Forest Classifier

Performs evaluation using:

Accuracy

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Confusion Matrix (with visualization)

5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation
